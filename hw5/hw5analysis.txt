1 Analyze the running time for figuring out which line a GOTO, GOSUB, 
0(log n) In hw5.cpp line 210~223, I used a map.find(command) to check if it is GOTO or GOSUB. it takes (logn ) to find something in the map

Analyze the running time for figuring out the command that a RETURN jumps to. That is, how long does it take to go from seeing RETURN until you know the command to go to.
I stored all the line form GOSUB in a stack in command.cpp line129~130. Then I  pop the top value in a stack to get the line to jump back to incommand.cpp line 151~155. So a stack.pop() takes 0(logn)

3 Analyze the running time for figuring out the value of a variable or overwriting the value of a variable.
The same as  GOTO ot GOSUB. O(logn) AS hw5line 211, I called a command->run which call a getvalue() function in AE class. It do map.find(variable) to get the value. So it takes O(logn)

4 Analyze the running time for figuring out the value of an array entry, assuming you have already figured out the numerical value of the index. 
It is exatly the same things as variable. I called command->run and this called map.find(array) to get the value .It takes O(logn)
