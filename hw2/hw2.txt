Problem 3

It will output 54321.
in Function A the while loop
  while (out->next != nullptr) {
    out = out->next;
    }

will change out to the tail of the linked list since tail->next = nullptr. 
the finally Function A return out which means return the address of the last element of linklist. 

In Function B

   if (in->next != nullptr) {
    funcB(in->next)->next = in;
   }

Will keep finding the last elements of linklist and assign last element->next to in, the first element. 
then it will point the (element->next)->next point to the address of element. 
For example: &4->next=&5
(4->next)->next = 4
5->next=4
(I can totally understand this how this function works but I feel it is so hard to explain it!)

Ands in function A funcB(in)->next = NULL; will point the first element->next to NULL.

So at last for the link list 1,2,3,4,5. will become 5,4,3,2,1
